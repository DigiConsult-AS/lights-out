# Lights Out

## Description
Lights Out is a simple, yet engaging, web-based puzzle game. The game features a 5x5 board where each cell can be either red or white. The objective is to turn all cells red by clicking on them. However, each click not only toggles the color of the selected cell but also the colors of its adjacent cells vertically and horizontally, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

## Features
- **Dynamic Board**: The 5x5 game board is dynamically generated and responsive to user interactions.
- **Shape Toggle**: Users can switch between square and circle shapes for the cells, affecting the aesthetic of the game.
- **Click Counter**: The application tracks and displays the number of clicks the player has made, adding an extra challenge to complete the game in the fewest clicks possible.
- **Winning Condition**: The game detects when all cells are red and displays a modal congratulating the player, with an option to play again.
- **Stylish Design**: The game features a clean and modern UI, with a neat toggle switch and a visually appealing color scheme.
